# My Chili
This is my chili recipe. I've been making it as long as I can remember. My parents, especially my mom, made a similar recipe when I was a kid, and that was the basis for this. I've modified it a little over the years. You can adjust all the ingredient amounts; this is not a precise recipe.

## Ingredients

1 medium onion, white or yellow
Fresh Jalapenos, sliced or diced (optional)
1 tablespoon peanut oil (or other neutral oil)
2 cloves garlic
5 - 7 (2oz) tablespoons chile powder (just ground chile peppers, nothing else)
1.5 tablespoon cumin powder
1 tablespoon cayenne powder
Black Pepper
Salt
2 pounds ground beef
2 - 4 cups of beef broth
About 28 oz diced tomatos from can, with juice
1 half lime

1. In a dutch oven, heat the peanut oil on medium-low. Sautee the onions (and sliced jalapenos if using) for 5 minutes to soften them, but don't allow them to brown; if they start to brown, reduce the heat. They will be cooked more with the beef.

2. While onions are cooking, mince the garlic cloves, set aside.

3. Adjust heat to medium-high and add beef. Stir, breaking beef into small pieces as it browns.

4. While the beef browns, mix the chile powder, cumin powder, cayenne powder, black pepper (about half a table spoon) in a small bowl.

5. When the beef has barely any pink visible, add the spices and garlic and stir on medium for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant.

6. Add 2 cups of beef broth or stock, adjust to medium high and cook most of the broth off, stirring almost constantly to keep the bottom from burning.

7. When thick, add tomatos. If more liquid is needed, add additional beef broth. You want enough that it can simmer for an hour with the lid cracked without running out of liquid. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer with lid cracked for an hour, stirring occassionaly 
   
8. Remove lid, add salt and lime to taste. Simmer with lid off until at desired thickness, stirring regularly.
